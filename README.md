# Approvals App

A simple Aragon App that allows people to submit intents based on a role, and forward intents after they 
are approved, or drop intents if rejected. Useful for when an organization wants to allow people to submit their 
desired actions publicly, while having a curation stage as well.

For example, we could use this app to improve our AGP process by allowing AGPs to be submitted in Aragon and have 
the Association review process happen on chain.
