The Approvals app is used to curate potential actions on a DAO. It allows people to submit intents based on a role, and 
forward intents in case they are approved, or drop them if rejected. Useful for when an organization wants to allow 
people to submit desired actions publicly, while having a curation stage before moving forward.

**Features**
- Approve or reject pending intents.
- See details about pending and solved intents.
- Give the Approvals app permission to perform actions in other apps so those actions have to be approved before being executed.
